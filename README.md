# BlobBuddy ðŸ‘»

BlobBuddy is your emotional support extension for VS Code, featuring Wisps â€” soft little flame-like friends who float beside you while you code. âœ¨

---

## Features

- **Custom Name**  
  On first activation, BlobBuddy asks what to call you. Your Wisp will address you by this name in all its messages.  
  Use **Wisp: Reset User Name** from the Command Palette to change it anytime.

- **Random Quips**  
  Every time you open the Wisp panel or return to the sidebar, your Wisp shares a fresh, encouraging message tailored with your name.

- **Mood-Based Animation**  
  BlobBuddy tracks how many compiler or linter **errors** you have:
  - **ðŸ˜Š Happy** (no errors)  
  - **ðŸ”µ Focused** (1â€“5 errors)  
  - **ðŸ˜Ÿ Worried** (more than 5 errors)  
  The Wispâ€™s flame gets a soft colored glowâ€”white, blue, or redâ€”matching its mood.

- **Continuous-Typing Break Reminder**  
  If you type continuously for **one hour** (allowing brief pauses under 5 minutes), BlobBuddy gently nudges you with a break reminder. 
  This reminder pops up even if you never open the Wisp panel!
